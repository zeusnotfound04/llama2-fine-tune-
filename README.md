## Overview

Llama 2 is a state-of-the-art language model by Meta, designed to handle a wide range of natural language processing tasks. This project focuses on fine-tuning the model using custom datasets to enhance its performance on domain-specific tasks.

The notebook covers:
- Preprocessing the dataset for training.
- Loading and configuring the Llama 2 model.
- Fine-tuning the model using supervised learning.
- Evaluating the model's performance on a test set.

## Requirements

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (with GPU support recommended)
- Hugging Face's Transformers library
- Additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (if provided)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fine_tune_Llama_2.git
   cd Fine_tune_Llama_2

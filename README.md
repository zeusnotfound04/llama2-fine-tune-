# Fine-Tuning LLaMA 2 on a Custom Dataset

This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to fine-tune the LLaMA 2 model on a custom dataset. The notebook utilizes Hugging Face's `transformers` library, along with PyTorch, to fine-tune the model for a specific task.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` for managing Python packages

### Required Libraries

```bash
pip install torch transformers datasets accelerate

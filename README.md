# Fine-Tune Llama 2

This project demonstrates the process of fine-tuning the [Llama 2](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama) language model to adapt it for specific tasks. The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook (`Fine_tune_Llama_2.ipynb`) that guides you through the fine-tuning process step by step.

## Overview

Llama 2 is a state-of-the-art language model by Meta, designed to handle a wide range of natural language processing tasks. This project focuses on fine-tuning the model using custom datasets to enhance its performance on domain-specific tasks.

The notebook covers:
- Preprocessing the dataset for training.
- Loading and configuring the Llama 2 model.
- Fine-tuning the model using supervised learning.
- Evaluating the model's performance on a test set.

## Requirements

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (with GPU support recommended)
- Hugging Face's Transformers library
- Additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (if provided)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fine_tune_Llama_2.git
   cd Fine_tune_Llama_2
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the Llama 2 model and tokenizer:

python
Copy code
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-2")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("meta-llama/Llama-2")
Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Fine_tune_Llama_2.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to:

Load your dataset and preprocess it.
Configure the training parameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size).
Fine-tune the Llama 2 model using your dataset.
Evaluate the model's performance and save the results.
Example command for launching the notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter lab Fine_tune_Llama_2.ipynb
Results
After fine-tuning, the model demonstrates improved performance on the specific task for which it was fine-tuned. Metrics such as accuracy, loss, and perplexity are recorded in the notebook.

Sample results include:

Improved text generation on the training domain.
Reduced perplexity on the evaluation dataset.
